                    <p>Deep Learning has potentially wide range of appications in Images, Sounds and Data</p>

                    <p><a href="http://usa.baidu.com/deep-speech-lessons-from-deep-learning/"><h4>Deep Speech Baidu</h4> </p></a>
                    <p>The performance of Deep Speech depends not only on its model but also on the data used to train it. It’s challenging to simply get enough transcribed audio data. There are two ways we can get more data for training. First, we can collect more real data in the wild. But real data is expensive and often hard to come by. So in addition to real data, we’re experimenting with ways to synthesize more data using existing data — learning from techniques in computer vision. For example, one approach we’re trying combines a clean snippet of speech with a separate noise snippet, creating a realistic sample of spoken audio with background noise. This allows us to create a training sample that sounds like speaking into a cell phone in a moving car without needing to take recordings on the road.</p>
					<p>We tested Deep Speech on 200 utterances, half collected in a quiet room and half from a variety of noisy settings, and compared performance to a selection of some of the best speech recognition systems. Deep Speech slightly outperformed the other systems on the clean samples. On the noisy samples Deep Speech showed significant improvement, outperforming the other systems by a large margin. We still see a large gap between even the best speech recognition systems and human level performance.  But by vastly scaling up a neural network architecture able to transcribe audio in an end-to-end fashion, Deep Speech has taken a step towards closing this gap.</p>

					<p><h5>Minwa is the star of Deep Image</h5><p>
					<p>Computers already possess some intelligence thanks to all the programs that humans have crafted and which allow them to “do things” that we consider useful (and that is basically what we mean for a computer to take the right decisions). But there are many tasks which animals and humans are able to do rather easily but remain out of reach of computers, at the beginning of the 21st century. Many of these tasks fall under the label of Artificial Intelligence, and include many perception and control tasks. Why is it that we have failed to write programs for these tasks? I believe that it is mostly because we do not know explicitly (formally) how to do these tasks, even though our brain (coupled with a body) can do them. Doing those tasks involve knowledge that is currently implicit, but we have information about those tasks through data and examples (e.g. observations of what a human would do given a particular request or input). How do we get machines to acquire that kind of intelligence? Using data and examples to build operational knowledge is what learning is about..</p>
                    
                    <p><a href="http://breakthroughanalysis.com/2015/03/05/ibm-watson-alchemy-api-and-a-world-of-cognitive-computing/"><h4>IBM Watson, AlchemyAPI</h4> </p></a>
                    <p><h5>World of Cognitive Computing</h5> </p>

					<p>AlchemyAPI uses a hybrid technical approach that combines statistical, machine learning, and taxonomy-based methods, adapted for diverse information sources and business needs. But what sets AlchemyAPI apart is the company’s foray into deep learning, the application of a hierarchy of neural networks to identifying both broad-stroke and detailed language and image features.</p>

					<p>So AlchemyAPI isn’t unique in the natural-language processing (NLP) domain, but the company does have lasting power. The success is measurable. AlchemyAPI, founded in 2005, was relatively early to market with an on-demand text analysis service and has won an extensive developer following although I’ll bet you $1 that the widely circulated 40,000 developer figure counts API-key registrations, not active users. The company is continually rolling out new features, which range from language detection and basic entity extraction to some of the most fine-grained sentiment analysis capabilities on the market. By contrast, development of the most notable early market entrant, OpenCalais from Thomson Reuters, stalled long ago.</p>
